# [PLAY IN PYTHON](https://play-in-python-5451a263c67c.herokuapp.com)

In this section, you will include a few paragraphs providing an overview of your project.
Essentially, this part is your "sales pitch".

In this section, describe what the project hopes to accomplish, who it is intended to target, and how it will be useful to the target audience.

Consider adding a mockup image using the "Am I Responsive" website.
Here's your deployed site as an example:
https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://play-in-python-5451a263c67c.herokuapp.com

## UX

In this section, you will briefly explain your design processes.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project,
and describe each in a sentence or so.

You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user,
focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve,
and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

### Future Features

- Title for future feature #1
    - Any additional notes about this feature.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- [Python](https://www.python.org) used as the back-end programming language.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com) used for version control. (`git add`, `git commit`, `git push`)
- [GitHub](https://github.com) used for secure online code storage.
- [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) used as a cloud-based IDE for development.
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) used for hosting the deployed back-end site.

## Data Model

### Flowchart

To follow best practice, a flowchart was created for the app's logic,
and mapped out before coding began using a free version of
[Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/ER-diagram-symbols-and-meaning) and/or [Draw.io](https://www.draw.io).

Below is the flowchart of the main process of this Python program. It shows the entire cycle of the program.

### Classes & Functions

The program uses classes as a blueprint for the project's objects (OOP). This allows for the object to be reusable.

The primary functions used on this application are:

- `get_sales_data()`
    - Get sales figures input from the user.
- `validate_data()`
    - Converts all string values into integers.
- `update_worksheet()`
    - Update the relevant worksheet with the data provided.
- `calculate_surplus_data()`
    - Compare sales with stock and calculate the surplus for each item type.
- `get_last_5_entries_sales()`
    - Collects columns of data from sales worksheet.
- `calculate_stock_data()`
    -  Calculate the average stock for each item type, adding 10%.
- `main()`
    - Run all program functions.

### Imports

I've used the following Python packages and/or external imported packages.

- `os`: used for adding a `clear()` function
- `colorama`: used for including color in the terminal
- `random`: used to get a random choice from a list

## Testing

For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

Code Institute has provided a [template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template) to display the terminal view of this backend application in a modern web browser.
This is to improve the accessibility of the project to others.

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://play-in-python-5451a263c67c.herokuapp.com).

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set the value of KEY to `PORT`, and the value to `8000` then select *add*.
- Further down, to support dependencies, select **Add Buildpack**.
- The order of the buildpacks is important, select `Python` first, then `Node.js` second. (if they are not in this order, you can drag them to rearrange them)

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: node index.js > Procfile`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The frontend terminal should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ilswh/play-in-python) 
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it 
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
	- `git clone https://github.com/ilswh/play-in-python.git`
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

Alternatively, if using Gitpod, you can click below to create your own workspace using this repository.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/ilswh/play-in-python)

Please note that in order to directly open the project in Gitpod, you need to have the browser extension installed.
A tutorial on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ilswh/play-in-python)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!

### Local VS Deployment

Use this space to discuss any differences between the local version you've developed, and the live deployment site on Heroku.

## Credits

In this section you need to reference where you got your content, media, and extra help from.
It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials,
however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism.

### Acknowledgements

- I would like to thank my Code Institute mentor, [Tim Nelson](https://github.com/TravelTimN) for their support throughout the development of this project.
- I would like to thank the [Code Institute Slack community](https://code-institute-room.slack.com) for the moral support; it kept me going during periods of self doubt and imposter syndrome.
- I would like to thank my family, for believing in me, and allowing me to make this transition into software development.
